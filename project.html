    <h3><b>Have financial markets and the economy become disconnected? The changing relationship between the macroeconomy and financial markets </b></h3>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an ever-growing disconnect between the real and financial economy. 
       As unemployment soared and GDP fell rapidly, stock markets soared as the Federal Reserve in the USA began to add to their balance sheets, 
       with Financial indexes such as the Russel 2000 and SP500 soaring and rallying to record highs. Even at a first glance comparing some macroeconomic 
       variables with US stock markets in the aftermath of COVID 19. This disparity is visually clear. The aim of my project was to empirically test for this 
       disparity in both a visual and statistical sense.</p>
       

   
    
   <h3>A Visual Divergence</h3> 
        
<div class="chart" id="firstprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart1 = "project_chart1SP500vsSentiment.json";
    vegaEmbed('#firstprojectChart', myprojectChart1);
  </script>
</div>
        
   <p>In this graph, I have Indexed the SP500 and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index to 100 in a local csv file As we can see from April
      there is a clear divergence in the indicators. Although they both drop in the wake of the pandemic, while consumer sentiment continues to slump, the
      SP500 recovers rapidly and begins to rally to all-time highs. Alternatively, consumer sentiment drops to levels not seen since 2011. Ideally I would
      have automated this data using the 'FRED' API, however I needed to index the data in excel in order to create a visually interpretable disparity.</p>
      
   <p>I should note that much of my representation of the 'financial economy' is based on the SP500. I made this choice as its revenue exposure is the most 
      global of all equity indexes. Additionally, it is highly liquid and hence its data is generally accurate does not require much cleaning.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="secondprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart2 = "project_chart2EquityIndexes.json";
    vegaEmbed('#secondprojectChart', myprojectChart2);
  </script>
</div>
   
    
   <p>Above, we can also see that this rally is not solely a U.S centric one. Here I have used an API to display the post-covid rally of four other equity
      indexes. The Nasdaq(USA), Dow Jones(USA), DAX(Germany) and Bovespa(Brazil).</p>
  
    
    
 <h3>A Sign of Overvaluation</h3>    
    
    
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart3 = "project_chartperatio.json";
    vegaEmbed('#thirdprojectChart', myprojectChart3);
  </script>
</div>
    

 <p>Above I have Web Scraped the 'Multpl' Website for the month by month Shiller PE Ratio data to test for an overvalued market. The pandas library achieved this
  with ease, and i was able to sort the data from old to new. I then downloaded the csv to my repository.</p>

<h3>A Test of the Culprit</h3>     
    
    
    
<p>In these charts I have decided to empirically test one of the main hypotheses for the cause of this divergence; Central Banks. Many believe that the divergence
   between the real and financial economy has been driven by the quantitative easing by central banks such as the Federal Reserve and hence equities have become
   overvalued. The chart below shows the increasing balance sheet of central banks in recent years as well as over COVID.</p> 
 
    
<div class="chart" id="fourthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart4 = "project_chartAssets.json";
    vegaEmbed('#fourthprojectChart', myprojectChart4);
  </script>
</div>
    
<p>Ideally I would have automated the chart above, however Data on Global Central. Additionally the way it is measured and reported in different countries
   is highly nuanced and therefore it made more sense to collate it into a csv file.</p> 
    
    
<div class="chart" id="fifthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart5 = "project_chartqe.json";
    vegaEmbed('#fifthprojectChart', myprojectChart5);
  </script>
</div>
    
<p>The chart above shows</p> 
    
<div class="chart" id="sixthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart6 = "project_chartCBRegression.json";
    vegaEmbed('#sixthprojectChart', myprojectChart6);
  </script>
</div>
    
<p>The chart above shows</p>    
  

 <h3>Investor Impact</h3> 
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>My final two charts were inspired by a concept called ‘Macroeconomic Class Factor Models’, that use statistical analysis to decompose macroeconomic 
       systematic risk. Using a multivarible regression using the sklearn toolkit library in a Colab Notebook in Python, I regressed macroeconomic factors. 
       I kept the number of factors limited in order to avoid the issue of collinearity.</p>
   


<div class="chart" id="seventhprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart7 = "project_chartpre.json";
    vegaEmbed('#seventhprojectChart', myprojectChart7);
  </script>
</div>
    
<div class="chart" id="eighthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart8 = "project_chartpost.json";
    vegaEmbed('#eighthprojectChart', myprojectChart8);
  </script>
</div>

       
   <p>There were some significant challenges in the above visualistation. Due to the way that some of these macroeconomic factors, their correlation 
      coefficients were highly varied in magnitude meaning that the data was extremely skewed. If the magnitudes were all positive I could have used
      a logarithmic scale however, this was not possible due to having negative coefficients as well as positive ones. Although it should be said that 
      comparing the coefficients at one point in time was not so much the point of this visualisation but rather to see how they had changed prior to 
      Covid and post Covid. And visually it is clear that they have. For example a decrease in unemployment was strongly associated with an increase i
      n the SP500 prior to Covid, but now that relationship has decreased to near 0.
