    <h3>Have financial markets and the economy become disconnected?'The changing relationship between the macroeconomy and financial markets'</h3>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an ever-growing disconnect between the real and financial economy. As unemployment soared
       and GDP fell rapidly, stock markets soared as the Federal Reserve in the USA began to add to their balance sheets, with Financial indexes such as the Russel 2000
       and SP500 soaring and rallying to record highs.
        
       Even at a first glance comparing some macroeconomic variables with US stock markets in the aftermath of COVID 19. This disparity is visually clear.

   <p>In this graph, I have Indexed the SP500 and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index to 100 in a local csv file. As we can see from April
      there is a clear divergence in the indicators. Although they both drop in the wake of the pandemic, while consumer sentiment continues to slump, the
      SP500 recovers rapidly and begins to rally to all-time highs. Alternatively, consumer sentiment drops to levels not seen since 2011.
