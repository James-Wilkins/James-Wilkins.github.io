    <h3><b>Have financial markets and the economy become disconnected? The changing relationship between the macroeconomy and financial markets </b></h3>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an ever-growing disconnect between the real and financial economy. 
       As unemployment soared and GDP fell rapidly, stock markets soared as the Federal Reserve in the USA began to add to their balance sheets, 
       with Financial indexes such as the Russel 2000 and SP500 soaring and rallying to record highs. Even at a first glance comparing some macroeconomic 
       variables with US stock markets in the aftermath of COVID 19. This disparity is visually clear. The aim of my project was to empirically test for this 
       disparity in both a visual and statistical sense.</p>
       

   
    

 
    

    
    
   <h3>A Visual Divergence</h3> 
        
<div class="chart" id="firstprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart1 = "project_chart1SP500vsSentiment.json";
    vegaEmbed('#firstprojectChart', myprojectChart1);
  </script>
</div>
        
   <p>In this graph, I have Indexed the SP500 and the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index to 100 in a local csv file As we can see from April
      there is a clear divergence in the indicators. Although they both drop in the wake of the pandemic, while consumer sentiment continues to slump, the
      SP500 recovers rapidly and begins to rally to all-time highs. Alternatively, consumer sentiment drops to levels not seen since 2011. Ideally I would
      have automated this data using the 'FRED' API, however I needed to index the data in excel in order to create a visually interpretable disparity.</p>
      
   <p>I should note that much of my representation of the 'financial economy' is based on the SP500. I made this choice as its revenue exposure is the most 
      global of all equity indexes. Additionally, it is highly liquid and hence its data is generally accurate does not require much cleaning.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="secondprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart2 = "project_chart2EquityIndexes.json";
    vegaEmbed('#secondprojectChart', myprojectChart2);
  </script>
</div>
   
    
   <p>Above, we can also see that this rally is not solely a U.S centric one. Here I have used an API to display the post-covid rally of four other global equity
      indexes.</p>
  
    
    
 <h3>A Sign of Overvaluation</h3>    
    
    
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart3 = "project_chartperatio.json";
    vegaEmbed('#thirdprojectChart', myprojectChart3);
  </script>
</div>
    

 <p>Above I have Web Scraped the 'Multpl' Website for the month by month Shiller PE Ratio data to test for an overvalued market. The pandas library achieved this
  with ease, and i was able to sort the data from old to new. I then downloaded the csv to my repository</p>

<h3>A Test of the Culprit</h3>     
    
    
    
<p>In these charts I have decided to empirically test one of the main hypotheses for the cause of this divergence; Central Banks. The following charts display...
    Ideally the data in these charts would have been automated and had come from.</p>
    
    
 
 
<div class="chart" id="fourthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart4 = "project_chartbalancesheet.json";
    vegaEmbed('#fourthprojectChart', myprojectChart4);
  </script>
</div>
    
<div class="chart" id="fifthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart5 = "project_chartqe.json";
    vegaEmbed('#fifthprojectChart', myprojectChart5);
  </script>
</div>
    

    
<div class="chart" id="sixthprojectChart">
  <script>
    var myprojectChart6 = "project_chartCBRegression.json";
    vegaEmbed('#sixthprojectChart', myprojectChart6);
  </script>
</div>
    
    
  

 <h3>Investor Impact</h3> 
    
    
    
    
    
    <p>My final two charts were inspired by a concept called ‘Macroeconomic Class Factor Models’, that use statistical analysis to decompose macroeconomic 
       systematic risk. Using a multivarible regression using the sklearn toolkit library in a Colab Notebook in Python, I regressed macroeconomic factors. 
       I kept the number of factors limited in order to avoid the issue of collinearity. A significiant issue i faced was that ... 
       It was not so important to compare
       the attribution of the factors in one period, but moreso how they changed before and after COVID.</p>
