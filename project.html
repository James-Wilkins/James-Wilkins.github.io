    <h3>Have financial markets and the economy become disconnected?'The changing relationship between the macroeconomy and financial markets'</h3>

    <p>Ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an ever-growing disconnect between the real and financial economy. As unemployment soared

       and SP500 soaring and rallying to record highs.
