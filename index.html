    <h3>Covid-19</h3>

    <p>The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by different regions within the UK. On the default chart 
       each region in the UK is split into different colours. Alternatively the user can use the drop
       down selectors to choose a region and view its data.</p>

<!--Vega embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

  <script>
    // Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
    // One way to tell is to see how comments work...
    // First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
    var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
    // Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
    // The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
    vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
  </script>

</div>

  <h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

  <p>The second chart looks at labour productivity within the UK from the early 1970s onwards.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
  <script>
    var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
    vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
  </script>
</div>
    
  <h3>UK Unemployment</h3>
    
  <p>My third chart presents the unemployment rate in the UK, of those aged over 16 years old.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
    <script>
      var myChart3 = "chart3_ukunemployment.json";
      vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
    </script>
  </div>
    
  <h3>1st Covid Vaccine</h3>
    
  <p>My fourth chart shows the number of people vaccinated with at least the 1st covid vaccine, taken from the Gov.UK coronavirus API.</p>
      
<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart4 = "chart4_1stdose.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
    </script>
  </div>
  
    <h3>Inflation in the USA</h3>
    
    <p>My fifth chart shows CPI in the USA from 1960 to 2021. It uses raw .csv data saved to my github repository, taken from the 'FRED' database.</p>
        
    
<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart5 = "chart5_uscpi.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
    </script>
  </div>
    
    
    <h3>California Wildfires</h3>
    
    <p>My sixth chart originally showed the top 5 wildfires in California by size,
       however I have made edits to the csv file by adding 5 other regions in California
       with fictional fires. These were Fresno, Ventura, Yuba, Colusa and Mariposa.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="sixthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart6 = "chart6_wildfireedit.json";
      vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
    </script>
  </div>
       
      
      
    <h3>Gross Federal Debt</h3>
           
    <p>My seventh chart shows Gross Federal Debt in the USA from 2012 to 2019. 
       Instead of using an API or raw csv in my github repository, I have manually 
       input the data points into my json file.</p>
       
<div class="chart" id="seventhChart">
    <script>
      var myChart7 = "chart7_GFD.json"
      vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
    </script>
  </div>
           
           
       <h3>ReMark Holdings Stock Price</h3>
             
       <p>This chart shows the intraday stock price of 'ReMark Holdings', a technology company that develops AI products.
          I chose this specific stock due to its extraordinary volatility on the day this chart was embedded, reaching an
          all time high on that day. I have used the AlphaVantage API for this respective data. As this is an intraday chart,
          every 24hrs the chart self updates.</p>
           
      
<div class="chart" id="eighthChart">

        vegaEmbed('#eighthChart', myChart8);
