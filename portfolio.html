    <h3>Covid-19</h3>

    <p>The first chart tracks Covid-19 cases by different regions within the UK. On the default chart 
       each region in the UK is split into different colours. Alternatively the user can use the drop
       down selectors to choose a region and view its data.</p>

<!--Vega embed, with notes for what is going on-->
<div class="chart" id="firstChart">

  <script>
    // Following the script tag we are using Javascript.
    // One way to tell is to see how comments work...
    // First job is to set the chart as a JS variable:
    var myChart1 = "chart1_covidUKRegions.json";
    // Now we simply insert it, using Vega's embed code:
    // The embed function needs to be told the location, and what to put there. 
    vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
  </script>

</div>

  <h3>Productivity puzzle</h3>

  <p>The second chart looks at labour productivity within the UK from the early 1970s onwards.</p>

<div class="chart" id="secondChart">
  <script>
    var myChart2 = "chart2_ukProductivity.json";
    vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
  </script>
</div>
    
  <h3>UK Unemployment</h3>
    
  <p>My third chart presents the unemployment rate in the UK, of those aged over 16 years old.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
    <script>
      var myChart3 = "chart3_ukunemployment.json";
      vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
    </script>
  </div>
    
  <h3>1st Covid Vaccine</h3>
    
  <p>My fourth chart shows the number of people vaccinated with at least the 1st covid vaccine, taken from the Gov.UK coronavirus API.</p>
      
<div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart4 = "chart4_1stdose.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
    </script>
  </div>
  
    <h3>Inflation in the USA</h3>
    
    <p>My fifth chart shows CPI in the USA from 1960 to 2021. It uses raw .csv data saved to my github repository, taken from the 'FRED' database.</p>
        
    
<div class="chart" id="fifthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart5 = "chart5_uscpi.json";
      vegaEmbed('#fifthChart', myChart5);
    </script>
  </div>
    
    
    <h3>California Wildfires</h3>
    
    <p>My sixth chart originally showed the top 5 wildfires in California by size,
       however I have made edits to the csv file by adding 5 other regions in California
       with fictional fires. These were Fresno, Ventura, Yuba, Colusa and Mariposa.</p>
    
<div class="chart" id="sixthChart">
    <script>
      var myChart6 = "chart6_wildfireedit.json";
      vegaEmbed('#sixthChart', myChart6);
    </script>
  </div>
       
      
      
    <h3>Gross Federal Debt</h3>
           
    <p>My seventh chart shows Gross Federal Debt in the USA from 2012 to 2019. 
       Instead of using an API or raw csv in my github repository, I have manually 
       input the data points into my json file. In my json code I have used the 'monotone'
       function in the 'interpolate' method of the vega library. This smoothens what otherwise
       would have been a purely linear graph which from a visual standpoint, makes the
       graph look more visually appealing.</p>
       
<div class="chart" id="seventhChart">
    <script>
      var myChart7 = "chart7_GFD.json"
      vegaEmbed('#seventhChart', myChart7);
    </script>
  </div>
           
           
       <h3>ReMark Holdings Stock Price</h3>
             
       <p>This chart shows the intraday stock price of 'ReMark Holdings', a technology company that develops AI products.
          I chose this specific stock due to its extraordinary volatility on the day this chart was embedded, reaching an
          all time high on that day. I have used the AlphaVantage API for this respective data. As this is an intraday chart,
          every 24hrs the chart self updates.</p>
           
      
<div class="chart" id="eighthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart8 = "chart8_api1.json"
        vegaEmbed('#eighthChart', myChart8);
    </script>
  </div>
    
    
      <h3>Cryptocurrency Spot Volume</h3>
          
          
      <p>Over the past few years cryptocurrency volume has spiked massively, with the rise of exchanges such as Binance, FTX, Coinbase
         etc. This chart represents this using the gradient design in Vega. The data is sourced from the 'Nomics' API.</p>
          
<div class="chart" id="ninthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart9 = "chart9_api2.json"
        vegaEmbed('#ninthChart', myChart9);
    </script>
  </div>
    
    
    
    <h3>Python API Request</h3>
    
    
    
    
    <p>Using the nomics API, A python script makes requests replacing the cryptocurrency choice in the URL 3 times (BTC, ETH, SOL, BNB).</p>
    
    
<div class="chart" id="tenthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart10 = "chart10_BTC.json"
        vegaEmbed('#tenthChart', myChart10);
    </script>
  </div>
    
    
<div class="chart" id="eleventhChart">
    <script>
        var myChart11 = "chart11_ETH.json"
        vegaEmbed('#eleventhChart', myChart11);
    </script>
  </div>
    

<div class="chart" id="twelfthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart12 = "chart12_SOL.json"
        vegaEmbed('#twelfthChart', myChart12);
    </script>
  </div>
    
<div class="chart" id="thirteenthChart">

        var myChart13 = "chart13_BNB.json"
        vegaEmbed('#thirteenthChart', myChart13);
    </script>
  </div>

    
    
    <h3>Web Scraper</h3>
    
    
    
    
    <p>This chart is a relatively basic implementation of a web scraper. Using Python, I scraped a table on tax rates sourced 
       from Wikipedia using the pandas libary before sorting and downloading the dataframe. Due to Wikipedia's formatting with
       numbered referencing e.t.c, the sorting of the table was not entirely accurate and some data had to be cleaned, therefore 
       removing an element of automation, however the concept still held strong.</p>
          
 <div class="chart" id="fourteenthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart14 = "chart14incometax.json"
        vegaEmbed('#fourteenthChart', myChart14);
    </script>
  </div>
          
    
    <h3>'All inflation is transitory'</h3>
    
    
    
    <p>At the Finance in Flux talk, John Turner, stated that in some ways 'all inflation is transitory'. In this graph I have decided to assess
       this statement. For inflation to be transitory, it should be short-lived and should have little impact on forward inflation expectations.
       The chart below shows monthly consumer inflation expectations in the uSA from the University of Michigan. These are now at the highest level since 
       around 2011, a year in which the Bank of England and Federal Reseve took a similar dovish tone to the current consensus, unwilling to change rates. </p>
    
 
 <div class="chart" id="fifteenthChart">
    <script>
        var myChart15 = "chart15_transitoryinflation.json"
        vegaEmbed('#fifteenthChart', myChart15);
    </script>
  </div> 
    
    
    <h3>'A British Philips Curve?'</h3>
    
    <p>In this chart I have used asessed the relationship between Inflation and Unemployment, taking monthly data from the ONS and Stata respectively from 1992 
       to present. I then performed a regression in Python using the pandas, seaborn and sklearn libraries. A vega visualisation in 'JSON' format 
       may have presented more options in terms of interactivity, however using python i was able to clean data more effectively.</p>

    <h3>Interactivity</h3>
        
    <p>For my final two project charts I have demonstrated the potential for implementing interactivity in vega lite. The first chart demonstrates
       the RPI inflation index in the UK from 1949 until present using the ONS API. The sliders below the graph enable you to select a Yearly Date 
       Range to zoom into the graph. The second, demonstrates the top 10 months in the past 20 years where the VIX was at its highest, meaning
       volatiltiy was highest in financial markets. These are quite notable events such as 9/11, the 2008 financial crisis and the onset of the COVID
       19 Pandemic.</p>
