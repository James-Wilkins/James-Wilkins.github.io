# Welcome to my Data Science github repository, here you can find my .py, .json, .csv, .html and .css files that make up my website for my portfolio and project. Any questions can be directed to qm19673@bristol.ac.uk. Please note that some charts may not work in safari/edge and you may have to use chrome/firefox instead.
