    <h3><b>Altman Z-Score</b></h3>
    
    
    
     <p>I've used the following code to implement an 'Altman Z-score' calculator in python. This uses a very simple formula from 1968
        to assess the likelihood of a firm going bankrupt based on various balance sheet metrics. It is currently very basic in that it
        takes direct user input in the code editor itself which is a bit tedious. I have some plans to actually embed it as an application
        on this website and implement some more appealing UI. Ideally, I would also like to link some API's to the code so that the Z-score
        can automatically calculated company by company, relying only on the minimimum information from balance sheets.</p>
